**Ctrl/Command** + click to open a link in a new window

The project offers the possibility to "subscribe" to an electronic magazine after filling in the necessary information. At each stage, its validity is checked using regular expressions.

### Developing this project, I practiced the following:
* Working with an external plugin - swiper
* Local storage
* Checking the validity of the entered information using regular expressions
* Event listeners
* Conditional addition of classes
* Flag variables
* Working with functions

The main difficulty in working on this project was the verification patterns of regular expressions, but after referring to my notes, I was able to solve this problem.
